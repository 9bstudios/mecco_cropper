# mecco_cropper

A MODO plugin that adjusts the current render camera's filmback settings to crop a render. Allows for storing multiple crops of a single shot via the render pass system. It was originally developed by Mechanical Color LLC as a proprietary paid product, and is now released as open-source under the MIT license.
